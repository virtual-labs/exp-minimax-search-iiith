This experiment is designed to illustrate the Minimax Search algorithm in strategy games, focusing on its decision-making process.

## Objectives

### Interactive Decision Tree Visualization
- Graphical representation of decision-making process.
- Illustration of depth-first search and minimax decision rule.

### Customizable Game Scenarios
- Adjustable parameters like depth of search on different graphs with different values.
- Insights into algorithm performance in various scenarios.

### Optimal Move Selection and Adversarial Strategy
- Showcase of strategic balance in move selection.
- Emphasis on algorithm's response to opponent's actions.
